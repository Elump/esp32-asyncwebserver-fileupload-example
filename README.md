# esp32-asyncwebserver-fileupload-example

This is hopefully a simple example to demonstrate how to upload a file to an ESP32 using the AsyncWebServer, saving the files on to SPIFFS and having a simple upload progress bar displaced.

There are various instructions around the place, but they were all confusing and it took a long time to figure out what was needed, I hope these examples help someone.

## Example 1 - A simple single webpage that allows uploading
- the simplest of all the examples, nothing fancy here

---

## Exmaple 2 - Index with an Upload Button with authentication
- web page authentication
- single webpage
- file listing button
- file download button
- file delete button
- file upload button
- all done on a single web page that gets updated via javascript
